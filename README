Moodle Block that displays all speadsheets and charts created using the
moodle-atto_chart/moodle-filter_chart and moodle-atto_spreadsheet/moodle-filter_spreadsheet
plugins.

The block displays all spreadsheets in current course.  Clicking the "Open Manager"
link opens a manager in which users can browse all spreadsheets by course with links to 
the pages where the spreadsheet/chart resides.  You can alos view all
orphaned charts/spreadsheets.  Orphaned spreadsheets/charts are those that are currently
not used in any courses.
